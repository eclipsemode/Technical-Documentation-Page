                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control
                        over them.
                    </article>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
                        statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                        additional objects; for example:

                            <li class="article-list__item">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
                                respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                            <li class="article-list__item">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions
                                allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                                from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                                server.</li>

                    <h2 class="info__title">JavaScript and Java</h2>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static
                        typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming
                        conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
                        LiveScript to JavaScript.</article>
                    <article class="info__article">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types
                        representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
                        instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                        objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</article>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with
                        whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                        Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</article>

                        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</article>
