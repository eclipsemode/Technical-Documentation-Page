                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control
                        over them.
                    </article>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
                        statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                        additional objects; for example:

                                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and

                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static
                        typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming
                        conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
                        LiveScript to JavaScript.</article>
                    <article class="info__article">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types
                        representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
                        instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                        objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</article>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with
                        whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                        Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</article>

                        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case
                        sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
                        through "z" (lowercase).

                    </article>
                    <article class="info__article">With the keyword var. For example,

                    </code>
                    <article class="info__article">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

                    <article class="info__article">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict

                    <article class="info__article">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See

                    <h2 class="info__title" id="variablesc">Variable scope</h2>
                    <article class="info__article">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you
                        declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
                        only within that function.
                    </article>
                    <article class="info__article">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                        scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope)
                        that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
                        is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this
                        case is an if statement.
                    </article>
                    <code class="code__article">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5

                    <article class="info__article">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in

                    <article class="info__article">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the
                        window.variable syntax.
                    </article>
                    <article class="info__article">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                        or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a
                        variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                        iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                        The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with
                        a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore
                        characters.

                    <article class="info__article">You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or

                    <article class="info__article">It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                        expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code.
                        For example, do not use the following code:
                    </article>
                    <code class="code__article">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }

                    <article class="info__article">If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
                        common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                    </article>
                    <code class="code__article">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
